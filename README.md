# Kolmogorov Forward
The package solves the kolmogorov forward equation on a grid, i.e. the stationary distribution `g` that solves

`0 = -∂(μ g) + 0.5 * ∂^2(σ^2 g) + δ (ψ - 1)`

The function outputs a vector `g Δx`  which sums to one. The grid `x` is potentially non-uniform. If `σ` is not null at the boundary of the grids, the process is assumed to be reflected.

For instance, let us plot the stationary distribution of a brownian motion with null drift (a zipf distribution):
```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference
x = logspace(-4, 3, 100)
μ = zeros(x)
σ = 0.3 .* x
g = kolmogorovforward(x, μ, σ)
cumulativeg = cumsum(g)
using Gadfly
plot(x = log(x), y = log(1 .- cumulativeg), Geom.line, Guide.xlabel("log-x"), Guide.ylabel("log 1-cdf"))
```

To compute the stationary distribution of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
```julia
μ = collect(linspace(0.0, 0.04, 10))
μμ = [0.3 * (0.02 - x) for x in μ]
σμ = [0.01 for x in μ]
kolmogorovforward(μ, μμ, σμ)
```


# Aiyagari
- The package solves the Aiyagari model following Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and Moll (2015) "Heterogeneous Agent Models in Continuous Time"
```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference
# solve a static equilibrium
ap = AiyagariProblem(π = 0.0);
as = solve(ap)
```
- The package solves a dynamic version of the Aiyagri model following [Ahn, Kaplan, Moll, Winberry](How to solve heterogeneous agent models in continuous time, with aggregate shocks)

```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference, Gadfly
ap = AiyagariProblem(π = 0.0);
ρπ = 0.95
σπ = 0.007
as = solve(ap, ρπ, σπ)
time, V, g, K, r, w = simulate(ap, as)
plot(x = time, y = r, Geom.line,  Guide.xlabel("Years"), Guide.ylabel("Percentage points"), Guide.title("Interest Rate to Aggregate Productivity Shock"))
```
