ap = AiyagariProblem(π, K);

# Bansal Yaron

The package solves the PDE associated with the long run risk model of Bansal-Yaron (2004). This long run risk model is generally solved by log-linearization (i.e. assuming that the price dividend is log linear in state variables). Solving directly the PDE shows that the price-dividend actually displays substantial non linearity wrt volatility. The choice of parameters follows Bansal-Kiku-Yaron (2007). Explanations for the solution method are available [here](https://github.com/matthieugomez/HJBFiniteDifference.jl/blob/master/src/bansalyaron/bansalyaron.pdf).


```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference, Gadfly
byp = BansalYaronProblem(ρ = -log(0.9989), γ = 7.5, ψ = 1.5, νD = 0.0072, νμ = 0.038 * 0.0072, νσ = 0.0000028 / 0.0072^2, κμ = -log(0.975), κσ = -log(0.999))
