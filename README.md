# Kolmogorov Forward
The package solve kolmogorov forward equation on a grid.
Given a grid `x`, the vectors `μ, σ, δ, ψ`, the function returns `g` such that 
`0 = -∂_X(μ(x)g(x)) + 0.5 * ∂_X^2(σ^2(x)g(x)) + δ (ψ - 1)`
 The function outputs a vector `g` such that `Σ g = 1.0` (i.e. `g` is the product of the pdf and `Δx`). The grid is potentially non-uniform. It is assumed that the process is reflected at the boundaries of the grid.

As an example, let's compute the stationary distribution of a brownian motion with negative drift:
```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference
x = logspace(-2, 3, 100)
μ = -0.11 .* x
σ = 0.1 .* x
g = kolmogorovforward(x, μ, σ)
using Gadfly
plot(x = log(x), y = log(reverse(cumsum(reverse(g)))), Geom.line, Guide.xlabel("log-x"), Guide.ylabel("log-cdf"))
```

# Aiyagari
- The package solves the Aiyagari model following Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and Moll (2015) "Heterogeneous Agent Models in Continuous Time"
```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference
# solve a static equilibrium
ap = AiyagariProblem(π = 0.0);
as = solve(ap)
```
- The package solves a dynamic version of the Aiyagri model following [Ahn, Kaplan, Moll, Winberry](How to solve heterogeneous agent models in continuous time, with aggregate shocks)

```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference, Gadfly
ap = AiyagariProblem(π = 0.0);
ρπ = 0.95
σπ = 0.007
as = solve(ap, ρπ, σπ)
time, V, g, K, r, w = simulate(ap, as)
plot(x = time, y = r, Geom.line,  Guide.xlabel("Years"), Guide.ylabel("Percentage points"), Guide.title("Interest Rate to Aggregate Productivity Shock"))
```

# Bansal Yaron

The package solves the PDE associated with the long run risk model of Bansal-Yaron (2004). This long run risk model is generally solved by log-linearization (i.e. assuming that the price dividend is log linear in state variables). Solving directly the PDE shows that the price-dividend actually displays substantial non linearity wrt volatility. The choice of parameters follows Bansal-Kiku-Yaron (2007). Explanations for the solution method are available [here](https://github.com/matthieugomez/HJBFiniteDifference.jl/blob/master/src/bansalyaron/bansalyaron.pdf).


```julia
using HJBFiniteDifference, Gadfly
byp = BansalYaronProblem(ρ = -log(0.9989), γ = 7.5, ψ = 1.5, νD = 0.0072, νμ = 0.038 * 0.0072, νσ = 0.00000283 / 0.0072^2, κμ = -log(0.975), κσ = -log(0.999))
